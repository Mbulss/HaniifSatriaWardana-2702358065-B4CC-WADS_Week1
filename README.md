# Git Clone

Here we'll examine the git clone command in depth. git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.

# Git Fork

Forking a repository means creating a copy of the repo. When you fork a repo, you create your own copy of the repo on your GitHub account. When several developers want to work on a project but need to make changes that are inappropriate for the original repository, forking is frequently used in open-source software development.

 # Git Revert
 The git revert command can be considered an 'undo' type command, however, it is not a traditional undo operation. Instead of removing the commit from the project history, it figures out how to invert the changes introduced by the commit and appends a new commit with the resulting inverse content. This prevents Git from losing history, which is important for the integrity of your revision history and for reliable collaboration.
